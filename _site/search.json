Even in the face of government crackdowns in Saudi Arabia, activists took to Twitter to criticize the ruling family and call for regime change [Pan and Siegel (2020). Most scholars credit the internet, with a particular emphasis on Facebook, as catalyzing the Arab Spring uprising (Ruijgrok 2017).

Yet social media’s incendiary potential is not just limited to progressive causes Facebook, for example, has turned into a breeding ground for hate crimes, suicide, and misinformation. Facebook, a keystone of the internet in Myanmar, had become a lightning rod for hateful and incendiary posts, and by virtue of its algorithmic system, promoted posts that led to the 2017 Rohingya genocide.

In India, social media platforms have been weaponized by the leading Hindu nationalist party to organize hate crimes and mob violence. As an external human rights consultant hired by Facebook concluded, social media platforms have “become a means for those seeking to spread hate and cause harm” (Horowitz 2023).\nGiven social media’s disruptive potential, governments have invested in tools to censor, monitor, and control social media (Ron Deibert 2015). In some cases, these repressive measures have remained ineffective, while in others government attacks on free expression on social media platforms have resulted in documented self-censorship, neutralizing the potential of these platforms to be utilized as tools for resistance and information-sharing (Ong 2021; Zeitzoff 2017). Much of the scholarship on social media censorship has focused on authoritarian regimes (Reuter and Szakonyi 2015) based on the assumption that in democratic regimes, there is a far wider network of information exchange available (Ruijgrok 2017).

    "text": "Theory and Hypotheses\nIn many cases, state censorship has been shown to be effective in stifling political discourse (Chan, Yi, and Kuznetsov 2024). Through censorship and monitoring, governments seek to impose a cost on political action, making it more difficult to consider or be aware enough to participate in political actions deemed undesirable by those in power. Moreover, censorship and monitoring online spaces have the potential to result in biased information ecosystems biased towards those in power and against oppositional voices. In some nations that employ social media censorship, a “backlash” effect has occurred. Social media censorship has had a documented effect on increasing the self-censorship of moderate actors, who have more to lose (Ong 2021). As a result, we will see that only more radical voices will persist online in terms of calling for political action. Thus, the political landscape on social media will become more extremist.\nHowever, it is important to note that social media surveillance and censorship in undemocratic nations are often paired with legal action, imprisonment, physical violence, and the online harassment of those who criticize the government, thus raising the “cost” of political engagement to levels that threaten one’s personal safety (Chan, Yi, and Kuznetsov 2024).\n\n\n\nFigure 1: A scatterplot of two indicators: arrests for political content and government social media monitoring. A high score here means less arrests on the first indicator, and less monitoring on the second indicator (Digital Society Project).\n\n\nFigure 1 illustrates a relationship between social media monitoring and arrests in [YEAR] based on the V-Dem data set. While the two indicators are positively correlated, the countries located in Quadrant II are outliers to the positive correlation between social media monitoring and social media arrests. These countries demonstrate comprehensive social media censorship, yet employ minimal arrests for posting online content. Democratic countries such as Singapore, Great Britain, and the United States all fall into this category. \nBy mitigating punishment for political content, while maintaining social media monitoring, these countries might be able to avoid the negative repercussions of social media censorship, maintaining an open forum for discussion while restricting violent content. Individuals might continue freely post political content as they do not maintain a fear of repercussions for doing so.  \nIn democratic nations, social media censorship and monitoring might not operate under the same paradigms as in authoritarian nations. As compared to authoritarian nations, social media monitoring and censorship in democracies have a different goal. Thus, the virtue of being a democracy will effect the impact and usage of social media censorship. Censorship alone does not impact political engagement, but rather the environment in which it is applied. Thus, I propose,\nH1: Social media censorship in democratic countries will result in a lesser reduction of political action than in authoritarian countries."

    "text": "Research Design\n\nData\nTo measure social media censorship and monitoring, I will be utilizing variables from the VDem Dataset—an expert-coded data set that accounts for 202 countries. The variables of interest I am examining are from the Digital Society Survey, designed by the Digital Society Project.  Social media, as coded for in this measurement, includes both publicly visible and private messaging platforms, including Facebook, Flickr, Friendstar, Google+, Instagram, Myspace, LinkedIn, Twitter, VKontakte, Weibo, Signal Slack, Snapchat, and WhatsApp. Censorship is does not include censorship of child pornography, military and intelligency sectrets, or defamatory speech, unless these measures are used as a pretext for censoring political information or opinions. Country behavior is coded on an ordinal scale of 0-4 for a variety of different traits related to digital society. \nThe measurement captures the subjective perception of experts about censorship within countries. It has the distinct drawback of not being based on quantifiable country behavior. However, in 2020 Digital Society Working Paper found that V-Dem scores for democratic countries were corroborated by publicly available Facebook and Google data for take-down request (Meserve and Pemstein 2020). While V-Dem data extends back to the early 2000s, however, the data on social media use is spotty in the early 2000s (Meserve and Pemstein 2020). Thus, I will limit my data usage from 2009-2024. Additionally, I will be utilizing V-Dem’s Regimes of the World (RoW) measure to classify countries on a scale of democratic to authoritarian.\nThe datasets for measuring country-level censorship are the same as those utilized in the paper “Government Digital Repression and Political Engagement: A Cross-National Multilevel Analysis” which concluded that higher levels of social media censorship caused lower political participation (Chan, Yi, and Kuznetsov 2024). Thus, I will be able to directly engage with these past findings.\n\n\nVariables\nThe variables of interest for this project are:\n\nGovernment social media monitoring (v2smgovsmmon)\nThis variable measures the extent to which the government surveils social media content. I plan to create an index variable combining government social media shut down in practice, social media alternatives, social media monitoring, and social media censorship in practice. Lower values indicate higher rates of monitoring. This is common in V-Dem data, so that higher values indicate more democracy. In order to remedy this for my analysis I will reverse the scale so that my monitoring values is 1 - VDEM_monitoring.\nGovernment social media censorship in practice (v2smgovsmcenprc)\nThis variable measures the extent to which the government actively censors political social media content. Lower values indicate higher rates of censorship. This is common in V-Dem data, so that higher values indicate more democracy. In order to remedy this for my analysis I will reverse the scale so that my censorship values is 1 - VDEM_censorship.\nTypes of organization through social media (v2smorgtypes)\nThese variables measure the presence of various modes of political organizing through social media. VDem codes for: petition signing, voter turnout, street protests, strikes/labor actions, riots, organized rebellion, vigilante justice, terrorism, and ethnic cleansing/genocide.\nRegimes of the world – the RoW measure (v2x_regime)\nThis variable categorizes countries as either closed autocracies, electoral autocracies, electoral democracies, or liberal democracies. For this project I will be defining electoral democracies and liberal democracies as democratic states.\nAverage people’s use of social media to organize offline action (v2smorgavgact)\nThis variable measures specifically average people’s use of social media to organize offline violence. A higher value indicate a higher usage of social media.\nElites’ use of social media to organize offline action (v2smorgelitact)\nThis variable measures specificially “elites” usage of social media to organize political action. A higher value indicate a higher usage of social media.\n\nI will create a z-score index variable combining social media monitoring and social media censorship called “Social media monitoring and censorship.” I will also create a z-score index variable combining the average person’s use of social media to organize political action and the elite person’s use of social media to organize political action called “Use of social media to organize political action.” I am specifically focused on how social media is utilized to organize political action, rather than actual instances of political action. It is important to note that just because calls for rebellion might be posted online, that doesn’t actually translate to real-life action. However, I am specifically interested in how indivdiual actors feel emboldened to utilize social media, and what content is seen online.\nFigure 2: Descriptive Statistics of Variables\n0 indicates non-democracy, 1 indicates democracy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDescriptive Table of Censorship\n\n\nregime_binary\nmean\nsd\nrange\n\n\n\n\n0\n1.5765531\n1.2543614\n6.941\n\n\n1\n-0.2786667\n0.7613753\n3.857\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDescriptive Table of Social Media Monitoring\n\n\nregime_binary\nmean\nsd\nrange\n\n\n\n\n0\n1.88673199\n1.1231373\n5.568\n\n\n1\n-0.03874784\n0.9750552\n4.831\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDescriptive Table of Political Action\n\n\nregime_binary\nmean\nsd\nrange\n\n\n\n\n0\n-0.3141828\n2.308716\n12.622\n\n\n1\n1.1776760\n1.870794\n11.350\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmpirical Extension\nThere are a number of potential limits in comparing democracies and autocracies. For example, these different regimes employ different mechanisms of social media censorship and enforcement. In order to strengthen my causal analysis between regime type and social media censorship, in my empirical extension, I will control for arrests for social media censorship consider how social media censorship and monitoring individually impact political action. One might argue that monitoring, a lighter mode of state social media control, might allow for greater political action, while one might continue to see negative repercussions under censorship. If my findings hold when these two modes are separately examined, that would strengthen my argument that regime types impact how public discourse is effected by social media censorship.\nAdditionally, in order to support my theory that democracies have different motivations for censorship, I will examine how different types of political action, such as petition signing, are impacted differently from the more extremist uses of social media. If we see more democratic modes of political actions have been left untouched while more extreme modes have been negatively impact, one could argue that social media censorship, when employed under democratic premises, has the potential to fulfill its intended duty of quelling violence while maintaining a free forum of political speech.\n\n\nRegression Model\nI will use interaction terms to measure how democracy impacts I will be using country-level fixed-effects and year-level fixed effects to account for potential confounders. Additionally, I will lag my independent variable, social media censorship, to strengthen my causal inference so that censorship precedes political action.\nIn short,\nDependent Variable: “Use of social media to organize political action,”\nMain Independent Variable: “Social media monitoring and censorship”\nModerator: Democracy\nInteraction Term: “Social media monitoring and censorship” x Democracy\n\\[ PoliticalAction_it = β₀ + β₁·Censorship_{i,t−1} + β₂·Democracy_it + β₃·(Censorship_{i,t−1} × Democracy_it) + γ·X_it + α_i + δ_t + ε_it \\]\nFor H2, I will create a table and measure each coefficient of each political action included in the VDem dataset: petition signing, voter turnout, street protests, strikes/labor actions, riots, organized rebellion, vigilante justice, terrorism, and ethnic cleansing/genocide."

Thus, in order to analyze the unique impact regime type has on political action, I will utilize interaction terms in order to address my hypothesis.\nInteraction Term\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n    \n    \n      \n        \n        Interaction Term Model\n              \n                 \n                (1)\n              \n        \n        + p &lt; 0.1, * p &lt; 0.05, ** p &lt; 0.01, *** p &lt; 0.001\n        \n                \n                  (Intercept)\n                  0.005\n                \n                \n                  \n                  (0.034)\n                \n                \n                  lag_z_cens_mon\n                  -0.432***\n                \n                \n                  \n                  (0.031)\n                \n                \n                  regime_binary\n                  0.345***\n                \n                \n                  \n                  (0.051)\n                \n                \n                  lag_z_cens_mon × regime_binary\n                  0.417***\n                \n                \n                  \n                  (0.053)\n                \n                \n                  Num.Obs.\n                  2504\n                \n                \n                  R2\n                  0.175\n                \n                \n                  R2 Adj.\n                  0.174\n                \n                \n                  AIC\n                  6583.1\n                \n                \n                  BIC\n                  6612.3\n                \n                \n                  Log.Lik.\n                  -3286.562\n                \n                \n                  RMSE\n                  0.90\n                \n        \n      \n    \n\n\n\nInterpretation \\(\\alpha\\): The expected use of social media for democracies with low social media censorship is .18 standard deviations above the mean.\n\\(β1 = -0.432\\) is the effect of censorship on the usage of social media to organize political action when regime type is held constant.

This impact, however, is significantly lower—nearly negligible. However, it is statistically significant. Additionally, when we separate censorship and monitoring, the impact on non-democracies also disappears. While the larger trend remains, when we separate our index score, we see that the impact is reduced when we don’t group social media monitoring and censorship together.\nAdditionally, to see how censorship impacts different types of social media organized political action differently. I will run my same regression over a z-score of the different types of uses of social media for political action.\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n    \n    \n      \n        \n        Effect of Lagged Censorship on

deviations at a 5% significance level. The main forms of social media political actions that decreased were for strikes, vigilante actions, and terrorism—however none of these were statistically significant. When peeled apart, it appears that while social media censorship in democracies actually increases protests, but it does not substantially decrease extremism. Despite previous research that asserts that democracies censor in response to extremist violence (Meserve and Pemstein 2020), it appears that actual censorship has little impact on mitigating that violence."

    "text": "Discussion and Policy Implications\nMoving forward, to strengthen my analysis of democratic and non-democratic censorship, I would additionally like to utilize some form of matching to compare countries of similar censorship scores. Moreover, my research was limited by the fact that I relied on expert-coded data which can be subjective. Examining the nature of protests following censorship utilizing social media data, where I could analyze the actual character of posts can provide greater insight. Additionally, analyzing the actual censorship and monitoring practices by looking tangible laws and measures in these nations can move this conversation from abstract ideas of censorship and monitoring toward considering specific policies and practices.\nAs it stands, however, my research points to an inverse of existing scholarship that asserts social media censorship represses the usage of social media to organize political action. While most existing literature surrounds authoritarian countries, it appear social media censorship in democracies operates under different frameworks than it does in non-democracies. Through my regression. I found a statistically significant positive correlation between social media censorship and political actions in democratic nations. When I controlled for country-level, though my regression still observed a positive trend, it was no longer statistically significant. Moreover, the negative impact of social media on political action disappears in authoritarian, challenging the general assertion that social media censorship, when used by autocracies “works,” leading to repression on social media platforms. Perhaps it is less about the regime and more about the country-specific factors, such as social media culture and pre-existing political efficacy.\nIn democracies, the increased usage of social media to organize protests could be explained as a backlash to increased restraints on freedom. Democracies, maintaining civic freedoms, might allow for greater criticism of government measures, and individuals might feel more emboldened or entitled to fight for these freedoms. This project has pushed me to consider social media censorship and monitoring as a multi-faceted practice. It is easy to assume that censorship is inherently repressive, and in many cases it is. But sometimes, it part of a government’s duty in maintaining public safety. Misinformation and online radicalization are rampant issues in the news today. As democracies contend with what forms of content can be allowed online, they enter into the gray spaces of monitoring and censorship—a careful balancing act in the digital age."

    "text": "Social media is a political battle between activists wishing to speak out against repression and governments wishing to control dissent. Canadian political scientist, Ronald Deibert defines this tension as the era of “contested access.”1 As social media continues to be utilized to increase information access and encourage collective organizing, governments attempt to police free expression on social media platforms.2 In some cases these repressive measures have remained ineffective, while in others government attacks on free expression on social media platforms have resulted in documented self-censorship, neutralizing the potential of these platforms to be utilized as tools for resistance and information-sharing.3 One study found that even in the case of government censorship, the internet remained crucial in mobilizing political protests.4 However, at the same time, social media is not only a tool for democratic organizing—it has also been utilized as a means of weaponizing and mobilizing sentiment in order to harrass minorities or critics of the government. I am interested in how the presence of censorship upon social media impacts these dual utilities of social media. While the democratizing impacts of social media have been duly studied, I am also interested in the otherside of the coin."

I plan to create an index variable combining government social media shut down in practice, social media alternatives, social media monitoring, and social media censorship in practice.\n0: Extremely often. It is a regular practice for the government to shut down access to social media. 1: Often. The government shuts down access to social media numerous times this year. 2: Sometimes. The government shuts down access to social media several times this year. 3: Rarely. There have been a few occasions throughout the year when the government shuts down access to social media. 4: Never, or almost never. The government does not interfere with the access to social media, except in the cases mentioned in the clarifications section\nGovernment social media alternatives (v2smgovsmalt)\nThis variable measures whether there is access to non-government controlled platforms. I plan to create an index variable combining government social media shut down in practice, social media alternatives, social media monitoring, and social media censorship in practice.\n0: Essentially all social media usage takes place on platforms controlled by the state. 1: Most usage of social media is on state-controlled platforms, although some groups use non- state-controlled alternatives. 2: There is significant usage of both state-controlled and non-state-controlled social media platforms. 3: While some state-controlled social media platforms exist, their usage only represents a small share of social media usage in the country. 4: Practically no one uses state-controlled social media platforms\nGovernment social media monitoring (v2smgovsmmon)\nThis variable measures the extent to which the government surveils social media content. I plan to create an index variable combining government social media shut down in practice, social media alternatives, social media monitoring, and social media censorship in practice.\n0: Extremely comprehensive. The government surveils virtually all content on social media. 1: Mostly comprehensive. The government surveils most content on social media, with comprehensive monitoring of most key political issues. 2: Somewhat comprehensive. The government does not universally surveil social media but can be expected to surveil key political issues about half the time. 3: Limited. The government only surveils political content on social media on a limited basis. 4: Not at all, or almost not at all. The government does not surveil political content on social media, with the exceptions mentioned in the clarifications section.\nGovernment social media censorship in practice (v2smgovsmcenprc)\nThis variable measures the extent to which the government actively censors political social media content.\n0: The government simply blocks all social media platforms. 1: The government successfully censors all social media with political content. 2: The government successfully censors a significant portion of political content on social media, though not all of it. 3: The government only censors social media with political content that deals with especially sensitive issues. 4: The government does not censor political social media content, with the exceptions mentioned in the clarifications section\nUse of social media to organize offline violence (v2smorgviol)\nThis variable measures the usage of social media to organize offline violence.\n0: Frequently. There are numerous cases in which people have used social media to organize offline violence. 1: Sometimes. There are a few cases in which people have used social media to organize offline violence. 2: Never. People have never used social media to organize offline violence\nAverage people’s use of social media to organize offline action (v2smorgavgact)\nThis variable measures specifically average people’s use of social media to organize offline violence.\n0: Never or almost never. Average people have almost never used social media to organize offline political action. 1: Rarely. Average people do not typically use social media to organize offline political action. 2: Sometimes. There are a few cases in which average people have used social media to organize offline political action. 3: Often. There have been several cases in which average people have used social media to organize offline political action. 4: Regularly. There are numerous cases in which average people have used social media to organize offline political action\nElites’ use of social media to organize offline action (v2smorgelitact)\nThis variable measures specificially “elites” usage of social media to organize political action.\n0: Never or almost never. Elites have almost never used social media to organize offline political action. 1: Rarely. Elites do not typically use social media to organize offline political action. 2: Sometimes. There are a few cases in which elites have used social media to organize offline political action. 3: Often. There have been several cases in which elites have used social media to organize offline political action. 4: Regularly.

    "text": "Social media is a political battle between activists wishing to speak out against repression and governments wishing to control dissent. Canadian political scientist, Ronald Deibert defines this tension as the era of “contested access.” (Ronald Deibert et al. 2012) Social media has the potential to increase information access and encourage collective organizing. Even in the face of government crackdowns in Saudi Arabia, activists took to Twitter to criticize the ruling family and call for regime changes.(Pan and Siegel 2020). Most scholars credit the internet, with a particular emphasis on Facebook, as catalyzing the Arab Spring uprising. (Ruijgrok 2017). Given social media’s revolutionary potential, governments have invested in tools to censor, monitor, and control social media. (Ron Deibert 2015). In some cases these repressive measures have remained ineffective, while in others government attacks on free expression on social media platforms have resulted in documented self-censorship, neutralizing the potential of these platforms to be utilized as tools for resistance and information-sharing.(Ong 2021) (Zeitzoff 2017)\nMuch scholarship on social media censorship has focused on authoritarian regimes (Reuter and Szakonyi 2015) as in democratic regimes there is a far wider network of information exchange available (Ruijgrok 2017). However, it is important to recognize that formal democracies also engage in policies of social media censorship and monitoring. The United States has deployed the federal government in widespread social media surveillance campaigns. (“Social Media Surveillance by the U.S. Government  Brennan Center for Justice” n.d.)\nThis project focuses on social media repression in formal (electoral) democracies. I am interested in interrogating the relationship between social media repression and the utilization of social media. Social media can be utilized for a variety of political organizing activities, from petition signing to calls for explicit violence. Beyond merely changing the amount of political organizing that occurs on social media platforms, I am also interested in seeing if the character of this organizing changes as well. This research raises implications for how the act of censorship of social media in and of itself challenges both political conversations online, but more importantly the role that it plays in defining political action offline.\n\n\n\n\n\nExpectation: The presence of increased social media censorship will reduce political action organized online.\nExplanation: There has been plenty of research illustrating that state censorship can be effective in stifling political discourse.(Chan, Yi, and Kuznetsov 2024) When governments censor social media, it becomes more difficult for activists (regardless of positioning) to organize online. This leads to lower political action organized online.\n\n\n\nExpectation: The presence of increased social media censorship will only reduce democratic political action, with no effect on extremist mobilization.\nExplanation: Social media censorship has had a documented effect on increasing the self-censorship of moderate actors, who have more to lose.(Ong 2021) As a result, we will see that only more radical voices will persist online in terms of calling for political action. Thus, the political landscape on social media will become more extremist.\n\n\n\n\nI will be utilizing the VDem Dataset—an expert-coded data set that accounts for 202 countries. The variables of interest I am examining are from the Digital Society Survey, designed by the Digital Society Project. The principal investigators are Valeriya Mechkova, Daniel Pemstein, Brigitte Seim, and Steven Wilson. The dataset was constructed by a group of experts who coded each country on an ordinal scale of 0-4 for a variety of different traits related to digital society.\n\n\nGovernment social media shut down in practice (v2smgovsm)\nThis variable measures how often the government shuts down social media access. I plan to create an index variable combining government social media shut down in practice, social media alternatives, social media monitoring, and social media censorship in practice. A lower value indicates increased shutdowns.\nGovernment social media alternatives (v2smgovsmalt)\nThis variable measures whether there is access to non-government controlled platforms. I plan to create an index variable combining government social media shut down in practice, social media alternatives, social media monitoring, and social media censorship in practice. A higher value indicates more alternatives.\nGovernment social media monitoring (v2smgovsmmon)\nThis variable measures the extent to which the government surveils social media content. I plan to create an index variable combining government social media shut down in practice, social media alternatives, social media monitoring, and social media censorship in practice. Lower values indicate higher rates of monitoring.\nGovernment social media censorship in practice (v2smgovsmcenprc)\nThis variable measures the extent to which the government actively censors political social media content. Lower values indicate higher rates of censorship.\n\n\n\nUse of social media to organize offline violence (v2smorgviol)\nThis variable measures the usage of social media to organize offline violence. A lower value indicates a higher usage of social media.\nAverage people’s use of social media to organize offline action (v2smorgavgact)\nThis variable measures specifically average people’s use of social media to organize offline violence. A higher value indicate a higher usage of social media.\nElites’ use of social media to organize offline action (v2smorgelitact)\nThis variable measures specificially “elites” usage of social media to organize political action. A higher value indicate a higher usage of social media.\nTypes of organization through social media (v2smorgtypes)\nThese variable measure the present of various modes of political organizing through social media. VDem codes for:\n\nPetition signing\nVoter turnout\nStreet protests\nStrikes/labor actions\nRiots\nOrganized rebellion\nVigilante justice\nTerrorism\nEthnic cleansing/genocide\nOther\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\[ Y_{it} = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\text{Censorship}_{it} + \\gamma_i + \\delta_t + \\epsilon_{it} \\]\nI will be using country-level fixed-effects and year-level fixed effects to account for potential confounders.\nThere are three different modes of social media repression that I am interested in examining: social media censorship, social media monitoring, and access to social media alternatives. Therefore I will run three different models for measuring the treatment of social media repression to see if the mode of repression impacts the means of political action.\nFor H2, I will create a table and measure each coefficient of each political action included in the VDem dataset. These actions range on the spectrum of “extremism,” thus rather than simply categorizing action as “democratic” or “extremist,” it is far more insightful to see how specific action plays out.\n\n\n\nI will restrict my analysis to democratic countries. There are a number of democracies, such as Nicaragua and India, that employ tools of social media censorship. The structures of government, whether it be electoral or not, will impact the forms of political organizing invoked as well as the freedom of expression, presenting a potential confounder. For example, in an authoritarian government, an activist is much less likely to utilize petitions or elections as politically viable organizing tools. By restricting my analysis to democracies, it would allow me to rule out the differences of political organizing in democracies versus autocracies as a potential confounder."
