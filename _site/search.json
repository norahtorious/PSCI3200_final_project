    "text": "Social media is a political battle between activists wishing to speak out against repression and governments wishing to control dissent. Canadian political scientist, Ronald Deibert defines this tension as the era of “contested access” (Ronald Deibert et al. 2012). Social media has the potential to increase information access and encourage collective organizing. Even in the face of government crackdowns in Saudi Arabia, activists took to Twitter to criticize the ruling family and call for regime change [Pan and Siegel (2020). Most scholars credit the internet, with a particular emphasis on Facebook, as catalyzing the Arab Spring uprising (Ruijgrok 2017). Significant literature has identified social media’s ability to create a network of diverse people with similar grievances and enable them to recruit, organize, and coordinate action (Meserve and Pemstein 2020). Social media allows networked movement to reach and persuade peripheral individuals to join and act.\nFacebook CEO, Mark Zuckerberg’s grand claimed that, “Social media will, left to its own devices, bring about a new era of freedom and social progress” (Horowitz 2023). Yet social media’s incendiary potential is not just limited to progressive causes Facebook, for example, has turned into a breeding ground for hate crimes, suicide, and misinformation. Facebook, a keystone of the internet in Myanmar, had become a lightning rod for hateful and incendiary posts, and by virtue of its algorithmic system, promoted posts that led to the 2017 Rohingya genocide. (Horowitz 2023). Following the 2020 election, Facebook became a watering hole for the #StopTheStealMovement, which culminated in the 2021 January 6th attack on the U.S. Capitol. In India, social media platforms have been weaponized by the leading Hindu nationalist party to organize hate crimes and mob violence. As an external human rights consultant hired by Facebook concluded, social media platforms have “become a means for those seeking to spread hate and cause harm” (Horowitz 2023).\nGiven social media’s disruptive potential, governments have invested in tools to censor, monitor, and control social media (Ron Deibert 2015). In some cases, these repressive measures have remained ineffective, while in others government attacks on free expression on social media platforms have resulted in documented self-censorship, neutralizing the potential of these platforms to be utilized as tools for resistance and information-sharing (Ong 2021; Zeitzoff 2017). Much of the scholarship on social media censorship has focused on authoritarian regimes (Reuter and Szakonyi 2015) based on the assumption that in democratic regimes, there is a far wider network of information exchange available (Ruijgrok 2017). However, it is important to recognize that formal democracies also engage in policies of social media censorship and monitoring. For example, the United States has deployed the federal government in widespread social media surveillance campaigns [“Social Media Surveillance by the U.S. Government  Brennan Center for Justice” (n.d.). Towing a delicate line, democratic countries must balance their interest to preserve the democratic norm of free speech while mitigating the dangerous consequences of social media.\nDemocracies tend to work within legal frameworks to remove digital content (Meserve and Pemstein 2020). While there have been recorded instances of populist leaders in democracies resorting to social censorship to silence their critics, social media censorship has also been utilized as a legitimate tool for addressing violence and ensuring public safety (Ong 2021; Meserve and Pemstein 2020). In a working paper from the Digital Society Project, political science professors Stephen Meserve and Daniel Pemstein identified a correlation between terrorist attacks and increased social media censorship in liberal democracies such as France (Meserve and Pemstein 2020).\nThis project focuses on social media repression in formal (electoral) democracies. I am interested in interrogating the relationship between social media repression and the utilization of social media. Social media can be utilized for a variety of political organizing activities, from petition signing to calls for explicit violence. Beyond merely changing the amount of political organizing that occurs on social media platforms, I am also interested in seeing if the character of this organizing changes as well. This research raises implications for how the act of censorship of social media in and of itself challenges both political conversations online, but more importantly, the role that it plays in defining political action offline."

    "text": "Theory and Hypotheses\nIn many cases, state censorship has been shown to be effective in stifling political discourse (Chan, Yi, and Kuznetsov 2024). Through censorship and monitoring, governments seek to impose a cost on political action, making it more difficult to consider or be aware enough to participate in political actions deemed undesirable by those in power. Moreover, censorship and monitoring online spaces have the potential to result in biased information ecosystems biased towards those in power and against oppositional voices. In some nations that employ social media censorship, a “backlash” effect has occurred. Social media censorship has had a documented effect on increasing the self-censorship of moderate actors, who have more to lose (Ong 2021). As a result, we will see that only more radical voices will persist online in terms of calling for political action. Thus, the political landscape on social media will become more extremist.\nHowever, it is important to note that social media surveillance and censorship in undemocratic nations are often paired with legal action, imprisonment, physical violence, and the online harassment of those who criticize the government, thus raising the “cost” of political engagement to levels that threaten one’s personal safety (Chan, Yi, and Kuznetsov 2024).\n\n\n\nFigure 1: A scatterplot of two indicators: arrests for political content and government social media monitoring. A high score here means less arrests on the first indicator, and less monitoring on the second indicator (Digital Society Project).\n\n\nFigure 1 illustrates a relationship between social media monitoring and arrests in [YEAR] based on the V-Dem data set. While the two indicators are positively correlated, the countries located in Quadrant II are outliers to the positive correlation between social media monitoring and social media arrests. These countries demonstrate comprehensive social media censorship, yet employ minimal arrests for posting online content. Democratic countries such as Singapore, Great Britain, and the United States all fall into this category. \nBy mitigating punishment for political content, while maintaining social media monitoring, these countries might be able to avoid the negative repercussions of social media censorship, maintaining an open forum for discussion while restricting violent content. Individuals might continue freely post political content as they do not maintain a fear of repercussions for doing so.  \nIn democratic nations, social media censorship and monitoring might not operate under the same paradigms as in authoritarian nations. As compared to authoritarian nations, social media monitoring and censorship in democracies have a different goal. Thus, the virtue of being a democracy will effect the impact and usage of social media censorship. Censorship alone does not impact political engagement, but rather the environment in which it is applied. Thus, I propose,\nH1: Social media censorship in democratic countries will result in a lesser reduction of political action than in authoritarian countries.\nRather than crush dissent, these measures seek to ensure public safety, targeting the most violent actions online. Moreover, the lack of arrests and costly consequences for expressing one’s political opinion online might mitigate the backlash effect, as moderate actors will still feel empowered to express their opinions. I additionally propose: \nH2: In democratic nations, the presence of increased social media censorship will reduce extremist mobilization.\nThese hypotheses assert, in other words, that social media censorship, when employed under democratic premises, has the potential to fulfill its intended duty of quelling violence while maintaining a free forum of political speech."

    "text": "Research Design\n\nData\nTo measure social media censorship and monitoring, I will be utilizing variables from the VDem Dataset—an expert-coded data set that accounts for 202 countries. The variables of interest I am examining are from the Digital Society Survey, designed by the Digital Society Project.  Social media, as coded for in this measurement, includes both publicly visible and private messaging platforms, including Facebook, Flickr, Friendstar, Google+, Instagram, Myspace, LinkedIn, Twitter, VKontakte, Weibo, Signal Slack, Snapchat, and WhatsApp. Censorship is does not include censorship of child pornography, military and intelligency sectrets, or defamatory speech, unless these measures are used as a pretext for censoring political information or opinions. Country behavior is coded on an ordinal scale of 0-4 for a variety of different traits related to digital society. \nThe measurement captures the subjective perception of experts about censorship within countries. It has the distinct drawback of not being based on quantifiable country behavior. However, in 2020 Digital Society Working Paper found that V-Dem scores for democratic countries were corroborated by publicly available Facebook and Google data for take-down request (Meserve and Pemstein 2020). While V-Dem data extends back to the early 2000s, however, the data on social media use is spotty in the early 2000s (Meserve and Pemstein 2020). Thus, I will limit my data usage from 2009-2024.\nAdditionally, I will be utilizing V-Dem’s Regimes of the World (RoW) measure to classify countries on a scale of democratic to authoritarian.\nIn order to measure the impact of social media measurement on political engagement, I will be utilizing individual-level data from the World Values Survey 7. It covers 120 countries, and country samples are representative of the population (18 and above, living in private households) based on multi-stage stratified sampling and questionnaires administered face-to-face in their native language. Additionally, I will be utilizing V-Dem’s expert-coded measurement of the types of uses of social media.\nThe datasets for measuring country-level censorship and individual political participation are the same as those utilized in the paper “Government Digital Repression and Political Engagement: A Cross-National Multilevel Analysis” which concluded that higher levels of social media censorship caused lower political participation (Chan, Yi, and Kuznetsov 2024). Thus, I will be able to directly engage with these past findings.\n\n\nVariables\nThe variables of interest for this project are:\n\nGovernment social media monitoring (v2smgovsmmon)\nThis variable measures the extent to which the government surveils social media content. I plan to create an index variable combining government social media shut down in practice, social media alternatives, social media monitoring, and social media censorship in practice. Lower values indicate higher rates of monitoring. This is common in V-Dem data, so that higher values indicate more democracy. In order to remedy this for my analysis I will reverse the scale so that my monitoring values is 1 - VDEM_monitoring.\nGovernment social media censorship in practice (v2smgovsmcenprc)\nThis variable measures the extent to which the government actively censors political social media content. Lower values indicate higher rates of censorship. This is common in V-Dem data, so that higher values indicate more democracy. In order to remedy this for my analysis I will reverse the scale so that my censorship values is 1 - VDEM_censorship.\nTypes of organization through social media (v2smorgtypes)\nThese variables measure the presence of various modes of political organizing through social media. VDem codes for: petition signing, voter turnout, street protests, strikes/labor actions, riots, organized rebellion, vigilante justice, terrorism, and ethnic cleansing/genocide.\nRegimes of the world – the RoW measure (v2x_regime)\nThis variable categorizes countries as either closed autocracies, electoral autocracies, electoral democracies, or liberal democracies. For this project I will be defining electoral democracies and liberal democracies as democratic states.\nAverage people’s use of social media to organize offline action (v2smorgavgact)\nThis variable measures specifically average people’s use of social media to organize offline violence. A higher value indicate a higher usage of social media.\nElites’ use of social media to organize offline action (v2smorgelitact)\nThis variable measures specificially “elites” usage of social media to organize political action. A higher value indicate a higher usage of social media.\n\nI will create a z-score index variable combining social media monitoring and social media censorship called “Social media monitoring and censorship.” I will also create a z-score index variable combining the average person’s use of social media to organize political action and the elite person’s use of social media to organize political action called “Use of social media to organize political action.”\nFigure 2: Descriptive Statistics of Variables\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDescriptive Table of Censorship\n\n\nregime_category\nmean\nsd\nrange\n\n\n\n\nDemocracy\n-0.2786667\n0.7613753\n3.857\n\n\nNon-democracy\n1.5765531\n1.2543614\n6.941\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDescriptive Table of Social Media Monitoring\n\n\nregime_category\nmean\nsd\nrange\n\n\n\n\nDemocracy\n-0.03874784\n0.9750552\n4.831\n\n\nNon-democracy\n1.88673199\n1.1231373\n5.568\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDescriptive Table of Political Action\n\n\nregime_category\nmean\nsd\nrange\n\n\n\n\nDemocracy\n1.1776760\n1.870794\n11.350\n\n\nNon-democracy\n-0.3141828\n2.308716\n12.622\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmpirical Extension\nClearly, as indicated by Figure 2 and 3, non-democracies tend to censor social media at far higher rates than democracies. Thus, in order to ensure that it is not the extent of censorship driving the difference between democracies and non-democracies, but rather the actual regime. If there is still a greater impact of social media censorship on political action in non-democracies than democracies, that we can argue that the extent of censorship is not a confounder.\n\n\nRegression Model\nI will use interaction terms to measure how democracy impacts I will be using country-level fixed-effects and year-level fixed effects to account for potential confounders. Additionally, I will lag my independent variable, social media censorship, to strengthen my causal inference so that censorship precedes political action.\nIn short,\nDependent Variable: “Use of social media to organize political action,”\nMain Independent Variable: “Social media monitoring and censorship”\nModerator: Democracy\nInteraction Term: “Social media monitoring and censorship” x Democracy\n\\[ PoliticalAction_it = β₀ + β₁·Censorship_{i,t−1} + β₂·Democracy_it + β₃·(Censorship_{i,t−1} × Democracy_it) + γ·X_it + α_i + δ_t + ε_it \\]\nFor H2, I will create a table and measure each coefficient of each political action included in the VDem dataset: petition signing, voter turnout, street protests, strikes/labor actions, riots, organized rebellion, vigilante justice, terrorism, and ethnic cleansing/genocide."

While the democratizing impacts of social media have been duly studied, I am also interested in the otherside of the coin."

However, it is important to recognize that formal democracies also engage in policies of social media censorship and monitoring. The United States has deployed the federal government in widespread social media surveillance campaigns. (“Social Media Surveillance by the U.S. Government  Brennan Center for Justice” n.d.)\nThis project focuses on social media repression in formal (electoral) democracies. I am interested in interrogating the relationship between social media repression and the utilization of social media. Social media can be utilized for a variety of political organizing activities, from petition signing to calls for explicit violence. Beyond merely changing the amount of political organizing that occurs on social media platforms, I am also interested in seeing if the character of this organizing changes as well. This research raises implications for how the act of censorship of social media in and of itself challenges both political conversations online, but more importantly the role that it plays in defining political action offline.\n\n\n\n\n\nExpectation: The presence of increased social media censorship will reduce political action organized online.\nExplanation: There has been plenty of research illustrating that state censorship can be effective in stifling political discourse.(Chan, Yi, and Kuznetsov 2024) When governments censor social media, it becomes more difficult for activists (regardless of positioning) to organize online. This leads to lower political action organized online.\n\n\n\nExpectation: The presence of increased social media censorship will only reduce democratic political action, with no effect on extremist mobilization.\nExplanation: Social media censorship has had a documented effect on increasing the self-censorship of moderate actors, who have more to lose.(Ong 2021) As a result, we will see that only more radical voices will persist online in terms of calling for political action. Thus, the political landscape on social media will become more extremist.\n\n\n\n\nI will be utilizing the VDem Dataset—an expert-coded data set that accounts for 202 countries. The variables of interest I am examining are from the Digital Society Survey, designed by the Digital Society Project. The principal investigators are Valeriya Mechkova, Daniel Pemstein, Brigitte Seim, and Steven Wilson. The dataset was constructed by a group of experts who coded each country on an ordinal scale of 0-4 for a variety of different traits related to digital society.\n\n\nGovernment social media shut down in practice (v2smgovsm)\nThis variable measures how often the government shuts down social media access. I plan to create an index variable combining government social media shut down in practice, social media alternatives, social media monitoring, and social media censorship in practice. A lower value indicates increased shutdowns.\nGovernment social media alternatives (v2smgovsmalt)\nThis variable measures whether there is access to non-government controlled platforms. I plan to create an index variable combining government social media shut down in practice, social media alternatives, social media monitoring, and social media censorship in practice. A higher value indicates more alternatives.\nGovernment social media monitoring (v2smgovsmmon)\nThis variable measures the extent to which the government surveils social media content. I plan to create an index variable combining government social media shut down in practice, social media alternatives, social media monitoring, and social media censorship in practice. Lower values indicate higher rates of monitoring.\nGovernment social media censorship in practice (v2smgovsmcenprc)\nThis variable measures the extent to which the government actively censors political social media content. Lower values indicate higher rates of censorship.\n\n\n\nUse of social media to organize offline violence (v2smorgviol)\nThis variable measures the usage of social media to organize offline violence. A lower value indicates a higher usage of social media.\nAverage people’s use of social media to organize offline action (v2smorgavgact)\nThis variable measures specifically average people’s use of social media to organize offline violence. A higher value indicate a higher usage of social media.\nElites’ use of social media to organize offline action (v2smorgelitact)\nThis variable measures specificially “elites” usage of social media to organize political action. A higher value indicate a higher usage of social media.\nTypes of organization through social media (v2smorgtypes)\nThese variable measure the present of various modes of political organizing through social media. VDem codes for:\n\nPetition signing\nVoter turnout\nStreet protests\nStrikes/labor actions\nRiots\nOrganized rebellion\nVigilante justice\nTerrorism\nEthnic cleansing/genocide\nOther\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\[ Y_{it} = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\text{Censorship}_{it} + \\gamma_i + \\delta_t + \\epsilon_{it} \\]\nI will be using country-level fixed-effects and year-level fixed effects to account for potential confounders.\nThere are three different modes of social media repression that I am interested in examining: social media censorship, social media monitoring, and access to social media alternatives. Therefore I will run three different models for measuring the treatment of social media repression to see if the mode of repression impacts the means of political action.\nFor H2, I will create a table and measure each coefficient of each political action included in the VDem dataset. These actions range on the spectrum of “extremism,” thus rather than simply categorizing action as “democratic” or “extremist,” it is far more insightful to see how specific action plays out.\n\n\n\nI will restrict my analysis to democratic countries. There are a number of democracies, such as Nicaragua and India, that employ tools of social media censorship. The structures of government, whether it be electoral or not, will impact the forms of political organizing invoked as well as the freedom of expression, presenting a potential confounder. For example, in an authoritarian government, an activist is much less likely to utilize petitions or elections as politically viable organizing tools. By restricting my analysis to democracies, it would allow me to rule out the differences of political organizing in democracies versus autocracies as a potential confounder."

Most scholars credit the internet, with a particular emphasis on Facebook, as catalyzing the Arab Spring uprising. (Ruijgrok 2017).

In some cases these repressive measures have remained ineffective, while in others government attacks on free expression on social media platforms have resulted in documented self-censorship, neutralizing the potential of these platforms to be utilized as tools for resistance and information-sharing.(Ong 2021) (Zeitzoff 2017)\nMuch scholarship on social media censorship has focused on authoritarian regimes (Reuter and Szakonyi 2015) as in democratic regimes there is a far wider network of information exchange available (Ruijgrok 2017).

    "text": "Social media is a political battle between activists wishing to speak out against repression and governments wishing to control dissent. Canadian political scientist, Ronald Deibert defines this tension as the era of “contested access” (Ronald Deibert et al. 2012). Social media has the potential to increase information access and encourage collective organizing. Even in the face of government crackdowns in Saudi Arabia, activists took to Twitter to criticize the ruling family and call for regime change [Pan and Siegel (2020). Most scholars credit the internet, with a particular emphasis on Facebook, as catalyzing the Arab Spring uprising (Ruijgrok 2017). Significant literature has identified social media’s ability to create a network of diverse people with similar grievances and enable them to recruit, organize, and coordinate action (Meserve and Pemstein 2020). Social media allows networked movement to reach and persuade peripheral individuals to join and act.\nFacebook CEO, Mark Zuckerberg’s grand claimed that, “Social media will, left to its own devices, bring about a new era of freedom and social progress” (Horowitz 2023). Yet social media’s incendiary potential is not just limited to progressive causes Facebook, for example, has turned into a breeding ground for hate crimes, suicide, and misinformation. Facebook, a keystone of the internet in Myanmar, had become a lightning rod for hateful and incendiary posts, and by virtue of its algorithmic system, promoted posts that led to the 2017 Rohingya genocide. (Horowitz 2023). Following the 2020 election, Facebook became a watering hole for the #StopTheStealMovement, which culminated in the 2021 January 6th attack on the U.S. Capitol. In India, social media platforms have been weaponized by the leading Hindu nationalist party to organize hate crimes and mob violence. As an external human rights consultant hired by Facebook concluded, social media platforms have “become a means for those seeking to spread hate and cause harm” (Horowitz 2023).\nGiven social media’s disruptive potential, governments have invested in tools to censor, monitor, and control social media (Ron Deibert 2015). In some cases, these repressive measures have remained ineffective, while in others government attacks on free expression on social media platforms have resulted in documented self-censorship, neutralizing the potential of these platforms to be utilized as tools for resistance and information-sharing (Ong 2021; Zeitzoff 2017). Much of the scholarship on social media censorship has focused on authoritarian regimes (Reuter and Szakonyi 2015) based on the assumption that in democratic regimes, there is a far wider network of information exchange available (Ruijgrok 2017). However, it is important to recognize that formal democracies also engage in policies of social media censorship and monitoring. For example, the United States has deployed the federal government in widespread social media surveillance campaigns [“Social Media Surveillance by the U.S. Government  Brennan Center for Justice” (n.d.). Towing a delicate line, democratic countries must balance their interest to preserve the democratic norm of free speech while mitigating the dangerous consequences of social media.\nDemocracies tend to work within legal frameworks to remove digital content (Meserve and Pemstein 2020). While there have been recorded instances of populist leaders in democracies resorting to social censorship to silence their critics, social media censorship has also been utilized as a legitimate tool for addressing violence and ensuring public safety (Ong 2021; Meserve and Pemstein 2020). In a working paper from the Digital Society Project, political science professors Stephen Meserve and Daniel Pemstein identified a correlation between terrorist attacks and increased social media censorship in liberal democracies such as France (Meserve and Pemstein 2020).\nThis project focuses on social media repression in formal (electoral) democracies. I am interested in interrogating the relationship between social media repression and the utilization of social media. Social media can be utilized for a variety of political organizing activities, from petition signing to calls for explicit violence.
